- Create new AEE package build system
- Fix CMake build after cleaning up from xae version


version 2.2.22
Been awhile since this has been updated. :-(
- a bunch of work to drag this into the 21st century. ;-)
  bulk of it was converting incompatible ints. Change string termination
  from NULL to '\0'. Reverse a previous conversion from NULL to '\0' back
  to NULL and a bunch of other things that I can't remember.

version 2.2.15b
- modified new_curse.c to handle different subdirectory naming in terminfo 
  directory; first noted on Mac OS 10.2

version 2.2.15a
- properly set file name variables if no file associated with journal entry
- when generating menu for recovering from journal if there was no file
  name then use the journal name

version 2.2.15
- added ability to specify ee_mode so main menu for aee will look more like 
  ee's main menu

version 2.2.14c
- made more changes to correct behavior when reading DOS files
  with CR/LF, was incrementing counter when encountered LF but
  not pointer, causing incorrect behavior in corner cases when
  the last buffer read contained a CR as the last character

version 2.2.14b
- made changes to handle dos files better: fixed defect in which sometimes
  two lines would be joined

version 2.2.14a
- modified get_full_path() so that it gets the true path name even if the path
  specified is a full path (i.e., starts with a /)

version 2.2.14
- modified so that full path is determined for an edited file, and 
  comparison of full path is done with info in journal info file to 
  determine if the same file is being edited already
- corrected logic in diff function which caused the diff buffer to be 
  created and then deleted before the diff

version 2.2.13
- added a new command: 'diff' which provides the diffs between the editor 
  buffer contents and the file associated with the buffer
- minor change to have status_display called if string found in search
  (previously the status line would be blank)

version 2.2.12b
- modified to take into account Darwin (Mac OS X) to provide a 
  different option to strip the final executable

version 2.2.12a
- defect fix in file.c to correctly get the date info of the just written file

version 2.2.12
- added code to detect if the file was changed outside of the editor during 
  editor and notify user
- added code to check if the file is being edited already (at least by the 
  same user)

version 2.2.11
- added code to check for the parent process going away, since otherwise aee
  will become a run-away process (xae is unaffected, so the changes are
  ifdefed for aee only)

version 2.2.10
- modified aee.c to use a header file to specify the version number 
- modified control.c so that when a new file is saved the current working 
  directory is used as the path rather than the original working directory 
  (except of course if an alternate path is provided as the name of the file 
  to be saved)

version 2.2.9
- modified create.make and new_curse.c to allow defining TERMCAP file 
  location (since some distributions move the file)

version 2.2.8
- fixed defect which caused aee and xae to crash when recovering from a 
  journal where the session did not have a file name associated with the 
  journal
- added ability to specify a file name with the 'save' command, 
  previously a name would be ignored and the name prompted for (unless 
  a name were already associated).  Note, if a name is already 
  associated with the buffer any name supplied with the 'save' command 
  is ignored.

version 2.2.7
- fixed defect which caused core dump in xae when mouse cursor leaves 
  left side of window 

version 2.2.6
- corrected defect in control.c which prevented file from being saved in 
  restricted mode

version 2.2.5
- added 'home' key to Xcurse
- added options for 'text' and 'binary' modes 
- added sending carriage-return to pipe if dos_file is true (so that diffs 
  between the file and editor contents will work even with DOS files)
- fixed defect in new_curse
- added check for more select headers to get BSD_SELECT set in create.mk.aee

version 2.2.4
- fixed defect which caused line to be improperly resized when tab stops 
  changed

version 2.2.3
- fixed defect which caused segmentation fault if marking text on the last 
  line of a buffer

version 2.2.2
- added handling for DOS/Windows files (with CR/LF)
- minor changes to allow use of /usr/local/aee for help.ae and init.ae files

version 2.2.1
- Minor error and help message changes to improve usability

[aee-2.2.0-1]
- First announcement to Freshmeat
