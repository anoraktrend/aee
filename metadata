RECENT CHANGES: Lucy used "Github Copilot" to fix the multiple definitions in ncurses.h and .c,
she intends to go back and fix these herself once she learns more C.
Lucy has also updated the install-sh to allow users to install to a prefix and destdir, like other build systems.
Lucy has also modified the makefile and removed references to xae in the manpage file. She must ensure to excise references to that program as time continues.
