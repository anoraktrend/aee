.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIaee\fR and \fIxae\fR are non-modal editors, that is, the user does not need 
to switch from one mode to another to insert and delete text.  The editor is 
always in text mode.  Control sequences and function keys are used to perform 
the editing functions.  In the case of \fIxae\fR, the mouse can also be used 
to position the cursor, and perform text selection and pasting.
.PP
\fIrae\fR and \fIrxae\fR are the same as \fIaee\fR and \fIxae\fR 
respectively, except that they are restricted to editing 
the file(s) named on the invoking command line.  No other files may be opened 
or written, nor may shell operations be performed.
.PP
The arrow keys (up, down, left, right) may be used to move the cursor.  If 
the keyboard is so equipped, the \fBprev\fR and \fBnext\fR keys will move 
the cursor to the previous and next pages, respectively.
.PP
The \fBgold\fR key is a key that is used to provide alternate behavior for 
a key, much like a gold function key on a calculator keyboard.  So, for 
example, function key number 7 (\fBf7\fR) may be used for initiating a 
search, while pressing the \fBgold\fR key and then \fBf7\fR will produce 
a prompt for the string to be searched for.  The gold function can be 
assigned to any assignable key.  By default, the keys \fBf1\fR and 
\fBcontrol-g\fR (\fB^g\fR) are assigned the gold function.
.PP
The rest of the keys by default will behave as described below.
.\"

.SH OPTIONS
The following are accepted as options when starting \fIaee\fR or \fIxae\fR:
.RS
.IP -binary 22
When reading in the file, treat as a binary file (only special character is 
a new-line character).
.IP -e 22
Turn off echo from initialization file.
.IP -i 22
Turn off info window.
.IP -j 22
Turn off journaling.
.IP -n 22
Turn off highlighting of menu and info window borders.
.IP -r 22
Recover from failed edit session (using journal file from that session).
.IP -tab 22
Expand tabs to spaces.
.IP -text 22
When reading in a file, treat as text only (both carriage-return and new-line 
are special characters).
.IP +\fInumber\fR 22
Move cursor to start of line \fInumber\fR.
.RE
.sp
The following additional options are available for \fIxae\fR only:
.RS
.IP "-fn \fIfont\fR" 22
Specify a font for use with \fIxae\fR.  Resource name \fBBaseFont\fR.
.IP "-fg \fIcolor\fR" 22
Specify a foreground color (color of text).  Resource name 
\fBForegroundColor\fR.
.IP "-bg \fIcolor\fR" 22
Specify a background color.  Resource name \fBBackgroundColor\fR.
.IP "-geometry \fI=columns\fBx\fIlines\fR"
Specify a geometry for \fIxae\fR.  Resource name \fBGeometry\fR.

.SS Function Keys
.PP
\fIaee\fR uses the terminal's function keys to perform editing tasks.  By 
default, only keys \fBf1\fR through \fBf8\fR are defined.  (Although a 
terminal may have function keys, the keys may not send unique sequences 
that can be recognized by software, or may require particular settings in 
order to be useful.  If in doubt, ask your system administrator.)

.SS Menu Operations
.PP
Pop-up menus can be obtained by pressing the 
.B escape 
key (or 
.B ^[ 
if no 
.B escape 
key is present).  When in the menu, the escape key can be 
used to leave the menu without performing any operations.  Use the up and 
down arrow keys, 
.B ^u
and 
.B ^d 
or the 
.B space
or 
.B backspace
keys to move to the desired items in the menu, then press 
.B return 
to perform the indicated task.
.PP
The main menu in \fIaee\fR is as follows:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBleave editor\fR" 
If changes have been made, the user will get a menu prompting whether or 
not the changes should be saved.
.IP "\fBhelp\fR"
Displays a help screen, with all of the keyboard operations and commands.
.IP "\fBedit\fR"
Pops up a menu to allow the user to \fBmark\fR, \fBcopy\fR marked text, 
\fBcut\fR marked text, or \fBpaste\fR previously marked text.
.IP "\fBfile operations\fR"
Pops up a menu for selecting whether to read a file, write to a file, or 
save the current contents of the editor, send the contents of 
the editor to a print command (see the section \fBInitializing aee from a 
file\fR), as well as recovering from a previous edit session (see 
\fBRecovery\fR below).
.IP "\fBredraw screen\fR"
Provides a means to repaint the screen if the screen has been corrupted.
.IP "\fBsettings\fR"
Shows the current values of the operating modes, and margins.  By 
pressing return when the cursor is on a particular item, the value can be 
changed.  Also within this menu is an entry to allow the user to save the 
current configuration of the editor to a file.  
To leave this menu, press the \fBescape\fR key.  (See \fBModes\fR 
below.)
.IP "\fBsearch/replace\fR"
.br
Pops up a menu in which the user may choose to enter a string to search 
for, or search for a string already entered, or perform a replace string 
operation.
.IP "\fBmiscellaneous\fR"
Pops up a menu that allows the user to format the current paragraph, 
execute a shell command, or check the spelling of the text in the current 
buffer.

.SS Commands
.PP
Some operations require more input than one key can provide, or do not
need to be so easily accessed.  These commands are entered using the prompt 
provided by pressing the \fBcommand\fR (^E or ^C or gold f8) key.  The line 
commands are:
.sp
.RS 4
.IP "\fBauto\fRformat * " 22
Turn automatic paragraph formatting on.
.IP "\fBnoauto\fRformat *" 22
Turn automatic paragraph formatting off (default).
.IP \fBbi\fRnary* 22
Turn on binary mode.  Files read into the current session will be 
treated as binary files, that is, the only special character is the 
new-line character.  See also \fBtext\fR.
.IP "\fBbuf\fRfer [\fIname\fR]*" 22
This command will move from the current buffer to the 
buffer with the name given by the user.  If the 
buffer did not previously exist, it is created.
If no parameter is given, then the name of the 
current buffer is displayed.  Note: a buffer created with this command 
is not associated with a file, nor is it journalled.
.IP "\fBca\fRse*\(dd" 22
Specifies that the case of each letter is to be
taken into account in the search operation.
.IP "\fBnoca\fRse*\(dd" 22
Specifies that there is no distinction between 
upper and lower case during search and replace operations (default).
.IP "\fBcd\fR \fIdirectory\fR" 22
Change directory
.IP \fBch\fRaracter 22
Displays the ascii code of the character the cursor is on.
.IP "\fBdef\fRine [gold] \fIkey string\fR*" 22
Assigns all of the string 
following the key definition to the key 
specified by the user.  The commands allowed 
in the string are described in the SYMBOLS 
section.
.IP \fBdel\fRete 22
Deletes the current buffer (the initial buffer 
may not be deleted).
.IP \fBdiff\fR 22
Execute the \fIdiff\fR command comparing the contents of the edit buffer 
with the associated file and place the results in a separate buffer.
.IP "\fBecho\fR \fIstring\fR \(dg" 22
Echoes the string to the terminal during startup of \fIaee\fR.
.IP "\fBed\fRit \fIfilename\fR" 22
Edit another file.  A new buffer will be created in which the named 
file can be edited.  If no file is specified, a temporary buffer name is 
created for use within \fIaee\fR.  If journalling is on for the initial 
file being edited, journalling will occur for the new edit buffer as 
well.
.IP ee_mode*
Have \fIaee\fR's main menu look more like \fIee\fR's main menu.
.IP \fBei\fRght* 22
If your terminal has an eight bit character set,
then use this command to cause \fIaee\fR to send the 
eight bit value to your terminal.  The default 
condition is to display the eight bit character
as the decimal value of the character between 
angle brackets.
.IP \fBnoei\fRght* 22
If your terminal does not have an eight 
bit character set, use this command to cause \fIaee\fR 
to display eight bit characters as the decimal 
value of the character between angle brackets 
(251 is displayed as <251>).  This is the default 
condition.
.IP "\fBexi\fRt[!]\(dd" 22
Exit the current edit session writing out the main buffer to the 
file name used in entering the editor.  The optional exclamation mark allows
you to leave without editing the rest of the files in the list of files
specified when the edit session was invoked.
.IP "\fBexp\fRand*\(dd" 22
Causes spaces to be inserted when the tab key is pressed.  Spaces fill to the 
next tab stop.

.IP "\fBlit\fReral*\(dd" 22
Causes characters in search string to be matched one-to-one with characters
in the text.
.IP "\fBnolit\fReral*\(dd" 22
Allows metacharacters in the search string (default).
.IP "\fBmarg\fRins *\(dd" 22
Causes left and right margins to be observed (set using \fBleftmargin\fR 
and \fBrightmargin\fR).
.IP "\fBnomarg\fRins *\(dd" 22
Allows lines to be any length (disregards the margin settings).
.IP "\fBleft\fRmargin [\fInumber\fR] *" 22
Set the left margin to \fInumber\fR.  If no number is specified, then the 
current value is displayed.
.IP "\fBright\fRmargin [\fInumber\fR] *" 22

.IP "\fBstatus\fR*\(dd" 22
A status line is displayed on the bottom line of the screen.
.IP \fBnostat\fRus*\(dd" 22
Turns off the status line (default).
.IP "\fBsp\fRacing \fInumber\fR *" 22
Tabs will be spaced every \fInumber\fR spaces, unless other tabs are set 
using the \fBtabs\fR command.
.IP "\fBtabs\fR [\fIstops ...\fR] *" 22
Sets tabs to \fIstops\fR.  After the last user defined tab stop, tabs 
are the normal sequence of every eight columns, or as set using 
the \fBstops\fR command.  The first column is 0.
.IP "\fBunta\fRbs \fIstops ...\fR *" 22
Removes the specified tab stops.
.IP \fBte\fRxt* 22
Turns text mode (default) .  Files read in while in text mode are checked 
whether they are UNIX files or Windows files.  If carriage return 
characters are found immediately prededing a new-line character, the 
editor treats the file as a DOS file and discards the carriage-returns 
on read, and carriage-returns are inserted on file write.  The menu may 
be used to toggle between DOS file mode and UNIX file mode.  See also 
\fBbinary\fR.
.IP "\fBwind\fRows*\(dd" 22
This command specifies whether or not buffers 
are displayed on the screen simultaneously.  If \fBwindows\fR (default) is 
specified, then buffers exist on the screen together.

Write the current buffer out to the specified file.
.IP 0123456789 22
Enter a number to go to the line corresponding to that number.
.IP "\fB+\fR or \fB-\fR \fInumber\fR \(dd" 22
Moves forward or back the number of lines specified.
.IP "[<\fIinbuff\fR] [>\fIoutbuff\fR ] \fB!\fRcommand" 22
Execute the command following the exclamation mark in the UNIX shell.  The 
shell used is the one specified in the shell variable \fBSHELL\fR in 
the user's environment, or \fB/bin/sh\fR if \fBSHELL\fR is not defined.  You 
may send data from the buffer \fIoutbuff\fR (or the current buffer if 
\fIoutbuff\fR is not specified) out to the shell by using the right angle 
bracket (>).  You may read into \fIinbuff\fR (or the current buffer if 
\fIinbuff\fR is not specified) by using the left angle bracket (<) as shown.  
The data read in from the
command will be placed after the current cursor location in the buffer

.SS Search and Replace
.PP
\fIaee\fR's search facility provides several abilities.  The user may 
choose for the search to be case sensitive, or ignore the case (upper or 
lower) of a character (\fBnocase\fR is the default).  The user may also 
choose \fBliteral\fR, or \fBnoliteral\fR (the default) modes for the 
search facility.  The \fBliteral\fR mode interprets the search string 
literally, \fBnoliteral\fR means that some characters (called 
\fRmetacharacters\fR) have special meaning, as described below:
.sp
.KS
.TS

l l.
symbol	meaning

^	beginning of line

useful in middle of string with 
known beginning and end, but 
variable middle
T}

.PP
The carat (^) within the square brackets ([]) means that the search will match
any characters \fInot\fR within the brackets.  The carat \fImust\fR be the 
first character after the opening bracket.
.PP
The asterisk (*) may be useful when searching for a string to which you know
the beginning and end, but not what characters (if any) or how many may be
in the middle.  The first character after the asterisk should not be a
metacharacter (a character with special meaning).
.PP
The replace facility uses the same modes as the search facility.  The 
prompt for the replace operation shows the syntax for the input:
.sp 2
.RS 4
/string1/string2/
.RE
.sp 2
where the slash ('/') may be replaced by any character that is not in the 
search or replacement string, and "string1" is to be replaced by 
"string2".  When in \fBnoliteral\fR mode, the search string may be placed 
in the replacement string by using the ampersand ('&'), like so:
.sp 2
.RS 4
/old/abc&123/
.RE
.sp 2
Where "old" will be inserted between "abc" and "123".

.SS Recovery
.PP
If for some reason an edit session is interrupted, it is possible to 
recover the work done in the session.  This is accomplished via the 
information stored in the journal file, which is a record of the 
changes made to the text in the buffer 
while in the editor.  To recover a session in which a 
file named \fIfoo\fR was being edited, use the command:
.sp
.nf
.na
.RS
aee -r \fIfoo\fR
.RE
.ad b
.fi
.PP
This is only possible if the \fB-j\fR option was not used, since the 
\fB-j\fR option turns journaling off.
.PP
It is also possible to start \fIaee\fR with no arguments, and then to browse 
the journal files.  This is accomplished through the menus.  To perform this 
task, bring up the menu by pressing the \fBEsc\fR key, select \fIfile 
operations\fR, then select \fIrecover from journal\fR.  You should then be 
presented with a list of files to recover.

.\"
.SS Key Definitions
.PP 
The function keys and control sequences (alphabetic keys pressed with 
the control key) may be defined by the user to perform any of the functions
described below.  
.PP
The user may assign more than one function to each key, as 
long as each one is separated by one or more spaces.  The following describes 
the functions of the keys and how the user may redefine the keyboard during 
the edit session on the command line.  The same syntax is used in 
the \fIinitialization file\fR.
.PP
Note that the '^' is typed by the user in the following examples, and 
is \fBnot\fR generated by pressing the control key and letter, and that f2 is 
entered by typing an 'f' and then a '2'.
.sp
Examples:
.br
.na
.nf
.sp
.RS

	\fBdefine f2 /this is an inserted string/ cr\fR
.RE
.fi
.ad b
.sp
will cause the string between the delimiters (/) to be

the next line to the end, you may make the following key definition:
.sp
.nf
.na
.RS
	\fBdefine f3 dl cr left\fR
.RE
.sp
.fi
.ad b
This set of functions will delete to the end of line and append the next to the
end of the line, then insert a line at the cursor, and then move the cursor 
back to the end of the previous line, the position where you started.  This may
of course be assigned to any valid key.

.SS Initializing aee From A File
.PP 
\fIaee\fR checks for a file named \fIinit.ae\fR in \fI/usr/share/aee\fR, 
.I .init.ae 
in the user's home directory, then for \fI.init.ae\fR in the 
current directory.  (This file may be created manually or by using the 
menu entry '\fIsave editor config\fR' in the 'settings' menu.)  
If the file exists, it is read 
and initializes \fIaee\fR to the parameters as defined in the file.  By having 
initialization files in multiple places, the user may specify settings for 
global use, and then supplement these with customization for the local 
directory.  The 
parameters allowed in the \fIinit.ae\fR file are key definitions, turning off 
windowing, case sensitivity, literal searching, eight bit characters, as 
well as the ability to echo strings to the terminal (see the \fBCommands\fR 
section for the commands allowed in the initialization file).  An example 
follows:
.nf
.na
.sp
.RS
	define ^z rp
	define gold ^z prp
	define f3 und
	define f4 unmark
	define k0 srch
	define gold k0 psrch

	printcommand lp -dlaser
	echo \\033&jB
.RE

The above example assigns the command \fBreplace\fR to control-z, and 
\fBreplace prompt\fR to gold control-z, as well as setting \fIaee\fR to be 
sensitive to the case of characters during search and replacement 
operations.  It also defines the function keys \fBf3\fR and \fBf4\fR to be 
\fBundelete\fR and \fBunmark\fR respectively.  The \fBprint\fR command will 
send its output to the device 'laser' through the \s-1UNIX\s+1 command 
\fBlp\fR.  A string is \fBecho\fRed to the terminal which will "turn on" 
the user function keys on an HP terminal.

The user may wish to \fBecho\fR strings to the terminal when 
starting \fIaee\fB to
set up the terminal or other devices, so the \fBecho\fR facility is
provided.  \fBEcho\fR is applicable \fIonly\fR in the initialization file.
No quotes are required around the string to be echoed.  Characters may be
literal or escaped (using the backslash convention).  The \fB-e\fR option on
the invoking command line turns off the \fBecho\fR operation.  This may be
useful if you normally use one type of terminal (and echo strings for its
use), but occasionally use another terminal and do not wish the strings to
be \fBecho\fRed.
.PP
Operations allowed in the initialization file are noted in the 
list of commands with an asterisk (*).

.SS Shell Escapes
.PP
Sometimes it is desirable to execute shell commands outside of the editor.  
This may be accomplished by pressing a key assigned to the \fBcommand\fR
function (\fB^E\fR, or \fBgold F8\fR), and then entering an 
exclamation mark (!) followed by the shell command(s) to be executed.  It 
is possible to send data from the editor to be processed by a shell 
command and/or read data from a shell command into a buffer in the 
editor.  The format for this is as follows:
.na
.nf
.sp
.RS
	<\fIinbuff\fR >\fIoutbuff\fR !\fIcommand\fR
.RE
.sp
.ad b
.fi
where \fIinbuff\fR is the name of the buffer to receive the data and 
\fIoutbuff\fR is the name of the buffer to output to the shell command.  By
omitting the name of the buffer, the current buffer will be used.  For example,
if you have a list of names and wish them sorted, you could use the \s8UNIX\s0
command \fIsort\fR.  If you wished to view them while in the current edit 
session, you could use the following sequence:
.sp
.na
.nf
.RS
	<sorted >list !sort
.RE
.ad b
.fi
.sp
where \fIlist\fR is the name of the buffer containing the unsorted list, 
\fIsorted\fR is the name of the buffer to contain the sorted list, and 
\fIsort\fR is the name of the \s8UNIX\s0 command to be executed.  The data 
read in from the
command will be placed after the current cursor location in the receiving 
buffer.  If the specified buffer does not exist when the command is entered, 
it will be created.  You should be sure of the spelling of the name of the 
buffer to be the input of the command if you are specifying one.  
.\"
.\"
.\"
.SS PRINT Command
.PP
The \fBprint\fR command allows you to send the contents of the current buffer 
to a command specified by using the \fBprintcommand\fR operation in the 
initialization file.  The default is '\fBlp\fR', using the default device.  
.PP
If you choose to specify something other than the default command, the 
command should be able 
to take its input from \fIstdin\fR, since \fIaee\fR will set up a pipe to feed 
the information to the command.
.\"
.\"     paragraph formatting
.\"
.SS Paragraph Formatting
.PP
Paragraphs are defined for \fIaee\fR by a block of text bounded by:
.sp 
.RS 8
.IP \(bu 
Begin or end of file.
.IP \(bu
Line with no characters, or only spaces and/or tabs.
.IP \(bu
Line starting with a period ('.') or right angle bracket ('>').
.RE
.PP
A paragraph may be formatted two ways:  explicitly by choosing the 
\fBformat paragraph\fR menu item, or by setting \fIaee\fR to automatically 
format paragraphs.  The automatic mode may be set via a menu, or via the 
initialization file.
.PP
There are three states for text operation in \fIaee\fR: free-form, wrap, 
and automatic formatting.
.PP
"Free-form" is best used for things like programming.  There are no 
restrictions on the length of lines, and no formatting takes place.  Margins 
are not enabled for this state.
.PP
"Wrap" allows the user to type in text without having to worry about going 
beyond the right margin (the right and left margins may be set in 
the \fBsettings\fR 
menu, the default is for the right margin to be the right edge of the 
terminal).  This is the mode that allows the \fBformat paragraph\fR menu 
item to work.  The "observe margins" entry in the "settings" menu allows the 
user to toggle this state, as well as the \fBmargin\fR and \fBnomargin\fR 
commands (see \fBCommands\fR above).
.PP
"Automatic formatting" provides word-processor-like behavior.  The user 
may type in text, while \fIaee\fR will make sure the entire paragraph fits 
within the margins every time the user inserts a space after 
typing or deleting text.  Margins must also be enabled in order for 
automatic formatting to occur.  The "auto paragraph format" item in the 
"settings" menu allows the user to toggle this state, as well as the commands 
.B autoformat
and \fBnoautoformat\fR.
.\"
.\"     modes
.\"
.SS Modes
.PP
Although \fIaee\fR is a 'modeless' editor (it is in text insertion mode all the 
time), there are modes in some of the things it does.  These include:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBtabs to spaces\fR"
Tabs may be inserted as a single tab character, or replaced with spaces.
.IP "\fBcase sensitive search\fR"
The search operation can be sensitive to whether characters are upper- or 
lower-case, or ignore case completely.
.IP "\fBliteral search\fR"
Allows the user to specify whether regular expressions are to be used for 
searching or not.
.IP "\fBobserve margins\fR"
The left and right margins can be observed, or not.
.IP "\fBinfo window\fR"
A window showing the keyboard operations that can be performed can be 
displayed or not.
.IP "\fBstatus line\fR"
Display the file name, position in the file, and selected status indicators.
.IP "\fBauto indent\fR"
The editor can be set to automatically indent the newly inserted line the same 
as the previous line, or not (primarily useful for programming).
.IP "\fBoverstrike\fR"
Toggle text insertion or overstrike modes.
.IP "\fBauto paragraph formatting\fR"
While typing in text, the editor can try to keep it looking reasonably well 
within the width of the screen.
.IP "\fBmulti windows\fR"
Allow multiple buffers to be displayed at the same time, or only a single 
buffer at a time.
.IP "\fBinfo window height\fR"
Displays and allows the user to change the height of the information window 
displayed at the top of the terminal (window) with key mappings and commands.
.IP "\fBsave editor config\fR"
Used to save the current editor configuration to a file (see the 
section \fBInitializing aee from a file\fR).  In addition to the 
settings within the settings menu, tabs and key mappings are saved.
.RE
.PP
You may set these modes via the initialization file (see above), with a 
menu (see \fBMenu\fR above), or via commands (see \fBCommands\fR above).

.SS Mark, Cut, Copy, and Paste
.PP
To move large chunks of text around, use the control key 
commands \fBmark\fR (^U or f6), \fBcut\fR (^X or f7), 
and \fBpaste\fR (gold ^V or gold f7).  These commands allow you to 
mark the text you wish to use so that it may be put in the paste buffer.  The 
paste buffer differs from the buffers mentioned below in that you may not move
to it, and that it is only used for these operations.  Once the text has been 
placed in the paste buffer, you may move your cursor wherever you wish and 
insert the text there, as many times you wish, anywhere you want.  
.PP
Simply move the cursor to the start of a section of text you wish to mark, and
press the key assigned the control key function \fBmark\fR (^U or f6).  Move 
the cursor over the text you wish to place in the paste buffer.  The text 
between the cursor position at which you pressed the \fBmark\fR key and the 
current position will be highlighted.  Once you have marked all of the text 
you wish to place in the paste buffer, press the key for \fBcut\fR (^X or f7)
or \fBcopy\fR (^C or gold f6).  The
\fBcut\fR operation deletes the text from the buffer in which the text is 
contained, and the \fBcopy\fR operation simply places the text in the paste
buffer without deleting it.  Now you may move to another 
section and use the \fBpaste\fR function to insert it as many times as you 
wish.  
.PP
If you wish to copy several sections of text that are not adjacent to each 
other, you may use the \fBappend\fR function (gold ^B) to put the text you 
will mark at the end of the current paste buffer contents, or the 
\fBprefix\fR function (gold ^D) to 
place the newly marked text before the current paste buffer contents when you 
\fBcopy\fR or \fBcut\fR.  The \fBprefix\fR and \fBappend\fR functions are 
used in place of the \fBmark\fR function.
.PP
Sometimes you may start marking text, then decide to cancel the operation.  
It is possible to do that by using the \fBunmark\fR operation.  The 
\fBunmark\fR operation is not assigned to any key by default.
.\"
.\"	Buffer operations
.\"
.SS Buffer Operations
.PP 
\fIaee\fR allows you to examine more than one file in the editor during
one edit session.  This mechanism is known as buffers, and the first
buffer is called \fBmain\fR.  Buffers may or may not be viewed
simultaneously on the screen depending upon the wishes of the user.  The
default condition allows for the buffers to co-exist on the screen, but
this may be changed by using the command \fBnowindows\fR.  To return to
the default condition, enter the command \fBwindows\fR, and buffers will
co-exist on the screen.  You may switch between having windows and not
having windows at any time without losing information in the buffers.
\fIaee\fR will remind you that you have buffers if you attempt to leave
the editor without deleting them.
.PP
Buffers are created when you enter the command \fBbuffer\fR with a single
argument, which is used as the buffer's name.  This command not 
only creates the new buffer, but it moves 
the cursor to the new buffer.  This is also the way
to move to a buffer which already exists.  Buffer movement is also
facilitated by the control key commands \fBnb\fR (gold ^N) and \fBpb\fR 
(gold ^P), short for \fBnext buffer\fR 
and \fBprevious buffer\fR.  This is especially useful if you mistype or forget 
the name of any of the buffers you have created and have windowing turned off.
.PP
The command \fBbuffer\fR without any arguments displays the name of the 
current buffer.  
.PP
Buffers can be deleted by using the command \fBdelete\fR.  Simply move to the 
buffer to be deleted and use the command \fBdelete\fR.  You \fBcannot\fR 
delete the first buffer, called \fBmain\fR.  Note that all 
commands operate in the 
buffer in which your cursor is operating, so you may use the \fBwrite\fR and
\fBread\fR commands to save or read a file into the current buffer.
.\"
.\"	On-Line Help
.\"
.SH On-Line Help
.PP
On-line help is provided through the 'help' command or menu item.  This 
command uses a file with help information.  By default the help file is 
located in \fB/usr/share/aee/help.ae\fR, but this file may be located 
in the user's home directory with the name \fB.help.ae\fR, or in the 
current directory with the name \fBhelp.ae\fR.

.SH WARNINGS
.PP
A journal file will not be created if the user does not have write 
permission to the directory in which the file is to reside.
.PP
If the file to edit does not exist, and is to be 
created in a directory to which the user does not have write permission, 
\fIaee\fR will exit with an error without editing the file.
.PP
The automatic paragraph formatting operation 
may be too slow for slower systems.
.PP
Writing the information to the journal during some operations may be 
rather disk I/O intensive, which may impact performance noticably on 
slower systems.  Journal files may also grow considerably during an edit 
session, which may be a concern if there is little disk space available.  
Turning off journaling may be useful if performance is slow, but turning 
off journaling will mean the loss of data should a system or network 
failure occur while using the editor.
