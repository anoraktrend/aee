/*
 |	This file contains routines for performing journalling for aee and 
 |	xae.  Journalling is writing lines and information about them to a 
 |	file when the cursor moves away from them (if they have been changed 
 |	during the time the cursor was on the line).
 |
 |	The data structure ae_file_info contains the information about 
 |	locations in the file for where to find the information about the 
 |	current line, the information about the previous line, the info 
 |	about the next line, and the location of the actual text.  The 
 |	length of the line (which is important!) is contained in the 'text' 
 |	structure for the line.  
 |
 |	The format that the information is written into the file is as 
 |	follows:
 |
 |	+--+--+--+--+
 |	|  |  |  |  |	previous line info location
 |	+--+--+--+--+
 |
 |	+--+--+--+--+
 |	|  |  |  |  |   next line info location
 |	+--+--+--+--+
 |
 |	+--+--+--+--+
 |	|  |  |  |  |	text location
 |	+--+--+--+--+
 |
 |	+--+--+--+--+
 |	|  |  |  |  |	text length (in bytes, including terminating NULL)
 |	+--+--+--+--+
 |
 */

/*
 |	Also in this file are routines for managing information about what 
 |	journal files have been written, and the relationship between the 
 |	journal file and the file being journalled.  This helps when 
 |	recovering from a disaster, and could be used to determine duplicate 
 |	edit sessions, or a failed previous session.
 |
 |	The name of the file is ~/.aeeinfo, and there is a lock file named 
 |	~/.aeeinfo.L.  The format of ~/.aeeinfo is as follows:
 |
 |	32 30 /home/hugh/sources/aee/journal.c /tmp/hugh/journal/journal.c.rv
 |
 |	where the first number is the length (decimal) if the full file name, 
 |	the second number is the length of the journal file name, followed by 
 |	the file name, and the name of the journal file.  The fields are 
 |	separated by a single space (ASCII 32).
